“Remodeling Your Dream House” Project

Objectives: You will learn how to plan for remodeling and to stay within the budget 
•	list all work to be done and calculate all the areas for each type of work
•	decide how much paint, carpet, and ceramic tile you will need to buy 
•	calculate the cost for each type of work for different choices of tile and carpet 
•	analyze the total cost and present a final proposal
•	moreover, you will model something that is real and practical

The Problem:

You have a budget of $3,000 for remodeling your house.
I. You are planning to paint the outside walls, whose dimensions are shown in the Figure 1:

a.	How many square feet will you need to paint? (There are ten windows, each 5 ft by 3 ft; two semi-circular windows, each 6 ft in diameter, and one door 7 ft. by 4 ft that do not require paint.)

b.	The paint that you have chosen is available in gallon cans only. Each can covers approximately 450 square feet. You will use two coats of paint. How many cans will you need for the project?

c.	The paint you have chosen sells for $28.95 per gallon. What will be the cost to paint the house?

II. Also, you are planning to replace old carpet in all three bedrooms and ceramic tile in the 
kitchen and dining room floors. You would like to install a nice carpet and nice ceramic tile, but you are not sure if you can fit both into your budget002E

The Figure 2 shows the floor plan for your one story home:

d.	There are two choices for carpet and both are available in rolls 5 yard wide:
      The first choice - the carpet costs $18.95 per square yard;
      The second choice - the carpet costs $29.95 per square yard.
     
      Find the combined carpet area in your house.
      What are the dimensions of the piece of carpet you will need to buy?
      Find the cost of the carpet (both choices).

e.	There are two choices for ceramic tile and both are available in boxes with 12 tiles, each 1 ft by 1 ft. 
	The first choice - the tile costs $29.95 per box;
      The second choice - the tile costs $38.95 per box.

      Find the combined ceramic tile area in your house.
      Find how many boxes you will need to buy.
      Find the cost of ceramic tile (both choices).

III. Find the total cost of remodeling (go over all possible choices and find the best one that fits into your budget of $3,000). Write a summarized proposal. 

IV. Create and present a final proposal in Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet or Microsoft Word Table.

V. Present your project as a multimedia product.

Process:

Work within your assigned group. Brainstorm the project. 
Distribute the roles – who is responsible for the analysis, estimation and area (carpet, kitchen, and wall painting) calculations, cost analysis, project data, final proposal, and multimedia presentation?


1. Get familiar with the plan of the house. 
2. Work within your assigned group and have discussions. Do all the calculations and present your results (use different formats: Microsoft Excel spreadsheet or Microsoft Access database; feel free to write a C++ program – a plus).
      3. Calculate the total cost (by going over various different options and keeping the   
      budget in mind), make a decision, write a summarized proposal. 

4. Finally, present your project as a multimedia product - at least one per group (more – a plus). You can create a PowerPoint, or Empressr presentations, a short video clip, or other multimedia formats – be creative and have fun!

      In addition, every student has to present fully completed work on all steps of the 
      project and a summarized proposal (including rationale on selecting particular carpet or 
      tile) in a form of a written report.

      The format and look of the final product are very important. Do some research. Look 
      for good examples on the Internet.

      5. Email me the final product (file) at vaksmans@mcvts.net

Your product will be graded according to the project rubric.
     

Evaluation: This project will be counted as a Quiz – 30% of your grade. Pay attention to neatness and accuracy of your math work and reasoning, graphs, and final product.
